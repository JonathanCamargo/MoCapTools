### Purpose of this repo
This repository contains different tools to ease the MoCap analysis, including programmatically running OpenSim, and automatically gap-filling of data.

## Setting up this repo
In order to properly set up this repo, please make sure you have OpenSim downloaded and installed (http://simtk.org/frs/index.php?group_id=91), then run install.m to bind OpenSim to MATLAB, and to add this repo to your MATLAB path. For examples on how to use different functions in this repo, see +Osim/examples/example.m and +Vicon/examples/example.m
The new functions for labeling and marker swapping detection require the use of EpicToolbox (https://github.com/JonathanCamargo/EpicToolbox), please install it too if you get errors of not finding the "Topics" package.

### Purpose of the Sensor-Fusion subteam
Our team is part of the EPIC lab at Georgia Institute of Technology (www.epic.gatech.edu) focuses on instrumentation with wearable sensors, including IMU, goniometers, pressure sensors and a novel epidermal flexible emg.  We are interested in analyzing the information carried by these sensors to develop intent recognition algorithms and gait state estimation using machine learning techniques. During Fall, we are setting up a full data collection system including motion capture and force plates in our terrain park that includes ramps, stairs and ground level walking. This will allow to study the biomechanics of ambulation for different conditions and get a better background for the development of controllers for our assistive devices.

### Contributing to this repo
Please feel free to clone this repo and add whatever functionality you see fit. When adding code, please try to maintain the overall file structure outlined below.  

### Documentation
All of the files within this repo should be well documented through the Matlab runtime environment. In order to read the documentation, type `help` in the Matlab command window followed by the name of any file. If the file does not contain documentation *please* feel free to include and request a pull. Brief documentation for an entire package can be seen by typing `help Vicon` or `help Osim` into the command line, which pulls documentation from each function in the package folder. 

### Getting started
Check the examples inside the +Vicon folder and inside the +Osim folder
